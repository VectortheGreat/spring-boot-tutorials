# Spring Boot Tutorials

This multi-project contains examples and tutorials prepared for those who want to learn development with Spring Boot. Below, youâ€™ll find a guide on setting up, running, and learning the features of this project.

## Projects

1. **spring-rest-api**: This project provides a simple example of building a basic REST API without a database. It demonstrates core REST principles and follows a layered architecture.

2. **spring-data-jpa**: This project showcases REST API development integrated with a PostgreSQL database. It uses Spring Data JPA to manage data persistence and employs Spring Validation for data validation. Annotations like ```@OneToMany``` and ```@ManyToOne``` are used to establish relationships between data entities.

3. **exception-management**: This project demonstrates centralized exception handling in Spring Boot using ```@ControllerAdvice``` and ```@ExceptionHandler```. It provides a structured approach to handle various error types, allowing clear and user-friendly error responses for REST APIs.
